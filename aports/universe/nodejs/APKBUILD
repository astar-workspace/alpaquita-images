	# NOTE: We use bundled libuv because they don't care much about backward
	# compatibility and it has happened several times in past that we
	# couldn't upgrade nodejs package in stable branches to fix CVEs due to
	# libuv incompatibility.
	#
	# NOTE: We don't package the bundled npm - it's a separate project with
	# its own release cycle and version numbering, so it's better to keep
	# it in a standalone aport.
	#
	# astarivi: We use bundled openssl as using anything newer will cause 
	# the following tests to fail:
	#
	# test/parallel/test-tls-cert-regression.js
	# test/parallel/test-tls-client-getephemeralkeyinfo.js
	# test/parallel/test-tls-getcipher.js
	# test/parallel/test-tls-set-ciphers.js
	# test/addons/openssl-providers/test-legacy-provider-config.js
	# test/addons/openssl-providers/test-legacy-provider-option.js
	# test/sequential/test-tls-session-timeout.js
	# test/parallel/test-tls-junk-closes-server.js
	#
	# Related issue: https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/53382
	#
	# astarivi: We also use "full-icu" for intl, as using "system-icu" will
	# cause the following test to fail, due to unsupported encodings:
	#
	# test/wpt/test-encoding.js
	#
	# This seems to be an issue ack by upstream node, but they do not 
	# plan on supporting "system-icu" builds. Building with "full-icu" also
	# matches the default behaviour of node, which saves a few headaches
	# to build consumers.
	#
	# astarivi: TODO: Shared base64 lib patches were removed, as they caused
	# the linking stage to fail (and were broken due to changes in node.gyp). 
	# It may be better to wait for upstream Alpine aports to fix base64 lib 
	# support, rather than trying to do it here.
	#
	# astarivi: Disabled the following tests, as they always fail due to seagfault:
	#
	# test/sequential/test-single-executable-application.js
	# test/sequential/test-single-executable-application-assets.js
	# test/sequential/test-single-executable-application-assets-raw.js

	# TODO: Enable once SEA is stable enough (probably is in 22). This seems to be an issue
	# that is already fixed in current branch.
